 * made lasting. So the surface never changes colour between the two states, the layer over it does,
 * and a toggle that is both on and pointed at takes the one step between hover and press rather than
 * going still. There is no downward nudge on the press the way `Button` has one: a toggle has
 * already answered the press by staying pressed, and answering twice would read as unsure.
