 * A box that holds one block of content and keeps its size to what is inside it.

 * The height is the box's own: measured, and glided to each new one, so content that grows,
 * shrinks or re-wraps — a swap, a late font, a list that gains a line — never moves the page
 * beneath it. The width belongs to the page whenever the page sizes the box, and is measured and
 * glided the same way when it is the content that sizes it (a `w-fit` pill, a chip). Give it a
 * `height` and it holds that instead, which is how a fold stays closed at 0, or at a peek.
 *
 * The glide is a spring, sampled once into a `linear()` curve and handed to `Animation.animate()`,
 * so it runs in the browser rather than in a callback. An interruption reads the curve's own speed
 * and gives it to the next one, so a box that changes its mind mid-flight turns around from where
 * it is instead of starting from a standstill.
 *
 * It starts in the measurement itself, not a render later: a measurement arrives from a
 * `ResizeObserver` — outside React — so the clip and the first frame of the animation have to be
 * written in the same task, or the new content shows past the old height for a frame.
 *
 * The content is replaced in place, not remounted: no fade, no travel, no second copy of the
 * same text underneath — a clip and a measured glide are the whole of it.
