/**
 * The appearance every floating surface shares.
 *
 * A dialog, a drawer, a menu, a popover and a tooltip are drawn by Base UI parts of their own, but
 * the layer they sit on, the way they arrive, the arrow they point with and the viewport they slide
 * between are the same mechanics five times over. Resolved here once, they cannot drift apart: a
 * popover and a tooltip open on the same beat, and one fixed place to change the ladder.
 *
 * The classes are already merged through `cn()`, so a component that hands `className` in last
 * still wins — these are a starting point, not a lock.
 *
 * The layer ladder, which is the one thing a portal cannot work out on its own. Two overlays at the
 * same z-index are ordered by whichever portal mounted last, so every step is written down:
 *
 *   10 — chrome that stays above the page it moves over: a sticky header, a scrollbar, a swipe strip
 *   40 — a scrim
 *   50 — the popup the scrim belongs to: dialog, drawer, menu, popover
 *   60 — a tooltip, which explains something inside one of those
 *   70 — a toast, which is true whatever else is open
