 *
 * Read-only is not here either, though it looks like it belongs: `:read-only` matches every element
 * that is not editable, a `<button>` and a `<div>` included, so the tint would follow a select's
 * trigger around for its whole life. Only a field that can be typed into and is being withheld — the
 * input, the textarea — puts it on, and a control with a state of its own spells that state instead.
 *
 * Pointed at, and reached by keyboard, are the same edge: both step the border to `--input-strong`,
 * and both leave the focus outline off. A field already says with its own box where the reader is
 * working, and an input takes focus on every click rather than only on a tab, so an outline around
 * that box would be drawn nearly all the time. The colour is the shell's own second step and not the
 * ring's, because a hover that was a colour and a focus that was a ring would make one field look
 * like two different states of attention.
